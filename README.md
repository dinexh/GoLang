# üöÄ Go (Golang) Learning Roadmap for Full-Stack Developers & DevOps  

This roadmap provides a step-by-step path to learn **Go (Golang)**, focusing on core concepts, DevOps use cases, and backend development.

---

## üìç **Phase 1: Setup and Basics**  

### **1. Install Go on Mac**  
Use Homebrew to install Go:  
```bash
brew update  
brew install go  
Verify installation:

go version  
2. Set Up Environment Variables
Add Go environment variables to your ~/.zshrc:

export GOPATH=$HOME/go  
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin  
Reload your terminal:

source ~/.zshrc  
3. Learn Go Basics
Official Guide: A Tour of Go
Topics to cover:
Variables, Constants, and Data Types
Functions
Loops (for), Conditionals (if-else, switch)
Arrays, Slices, and Maps
Practice Task: Write a "Hello, World!" program:

package main  
import "fmt"  

func main() {  
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")  
}  
Run the program:

go run main.go  
üìç Phase 2: Go Intermediate Concepts

1. Functions and Structs
Functions: Parameters, return values, and multiple returns.
Structs: Custom types and methods on structs.
Example:

package main  
import "fmt"  

type Student struct {  
    name string  
    age  int  
}  

func greet(s Student) {  
    fmt.Println("Hello,", s.name)  
}  

func main() {  
    student := Student{name: "John", age: 20}  
    greet(student)  
}  
2. Concurrency in Go
Concurrency is Go‚Äôs superpower and a must-learn for DevOps.

Goroutines: Lightweight threads.
Channels: Communication between goroutines.
Resources:

Go Concurrency Patterns
Example: Goroutine and Channel

package main  

import (  
    "fmt"  
    "time"  
)  

func say(msg string) {  
    for i := 0; i < 3; i++ {  
        fmt.Println(msg)  
        time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)  
    }  
}  

func main() {  
    go say("Hello")  
    go say("Golang")  

    time.Sleep(time.Second)  
    fmt.Println("Done!")  
}  
üìç Phase 3: Building Real Projects

1. CLI Tools
Write a simple CLI program to automate file renaming or organize your folders.

Resource: Cobra CLI
2. Build a REST API with Go
Use the Gin framework:
go get -u github.com/gin-gonic/gin  
Example: Simple API

package main  
import "github.com/gin-gonic/gin"  

func main() {  
    r := gin.Default()  
    r.GET("/ping", func(c *gin.Context) {  
        c.JSON(200, gin.H{"message": "pong"})  
    })  
    r.Run(":8080")  
}  
Run the server:

go run main.go  
Test it:
http://localhost:8080/ping

üìç Phase 4: DevOps and Go

1. Dockerize Your Go Application
Create a Dockerfile:
FROM golang:1.22  
WORKDIR /app  
COPY . .  
RUN go build -o main .  
CMD ["./main"]  
EXPOSE 8080  
Build and Run:
docker build -t my-go-app .  
docker run -p 8080:8080 my-go-app  
2. Kubernetes and Go
Learn the basics of Kubernetes deployments.
Deploy your Dockerized Go app into a K8s cluster using minikube.
Resources:

Kubernetes Official Docs
üìç Phase 5: Advanced Topics

1. Microservices with Go
Use gRPC for communication between services.
Learn about protobuf and service discovery.
Resources:

gRPC in Go
2. Integrate Databases
Learn to use PostgreSQL/MySQL with Go using the database/sql package.

ORM: Use libraries like GORM.
Example: Connect to MySQL

package main  
import (  
    "database/sql"  
    "fmt"  
    _ "github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql"  
)  

func main() {  
    db, err := sql.Open("mysql", "user:password@/dbname")  
    if err != nil {  
        panic(err.Error())  
    }  
    defer db.Close()  
    fmt.Println("Database connected!")  
}  
3. Testing in Go
Write unit tests using the testing package.

Example Test:

package main  
import "testing"  

func add(a, b int) int {  
    return a + b  
}  

func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {  
    result := add(2, 3)  
    if result != 5 {  
        t.Errorf("Expected 5, but got %d", result)  
    }  
}  
Run tests:

go test
